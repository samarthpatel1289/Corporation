# 🏢 The Corporation – Party Game

**The Corporation** is a social word-guessing party game where players build mock "companies" by identifying which secret word belongs to whom. The goal? Acquire everyone and become the ultimate CEO.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Correctly guess which word belongs to each player. When you’re right, that player joins your company. The game ends when one corporation has acquired everyone.

---

## 👥 Players

- 4 or more (ideal: 6–10)
- The more players, the more hilarious it gets

---

## 📝 Setup

1. Each player writes **one secret word** on a slip of paper.
2. Fold and place all words in a bowl.
3. One player (the **Reader**) reads all words aloud **once**. No repeats.
4. The bowl is removed — all words must be remembered.

---

## 🚀 How to Play

1. A random player starts by guessing which word belongs to whom.
2. If they’re **correct**:
   - The guessed player joins their “company” as an **Employee**.
   - The guesser becomes (or stays) the **CEO**.
   - They continue guessing — now with help from Employees.
3. If they’re **wrong**:
   - The person who was wrongly guessed now becomes the guesser (starting their own company if needed).
4. Turns continue until all players are acquired into a single corporation.

## 🧠 Roles

- **Free Agent** – not yet acquired
- **CEO** – player with at least one employee
- **Employee** – a player who’s been guessed correctly

Only CEOs can guess. Employees assist with subtle suggestions, but only the CEO makes the call.

## 🏁 Winning

The game ends when **one company has everyone**.

That CEO is declared **Supreme Corporate Overlord™**.

---

## 🔄 Optional Variants

- **Fake Word**: Add one decoy word to the bowl that belongs to no one.
- **Silent Employees**: Employees can’t speak, only gesture.
- **Speed Round**: 30 seconds per turn.
- **Double Words**: Each player submits two secret words.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Choose interesting or misleading words to throw others off.
- Memory is key — there are no repeats!
- Teamwork pays off — employees can turn a small company into a corporate empire.
